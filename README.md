The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management.
The goal of this section of the course is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.

More updates on portfolio optimisatiion will be coming up soon. That will include factors like Greek Optimisations, and investment factors. We'll be using CAPM method, and different ratios and measures such as Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen’s alpha and more to calculate best invesment techniques.
